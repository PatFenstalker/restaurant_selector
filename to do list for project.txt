give me the option to select a number of resturaunts from the companion document (done)

randomly select which resturaunt we go to (done-ish)

make gui (done)


steps for selection:

for more than two options:

roll dice 

whichever gets 3 first wins


for two options:

flip a coin

whichever gets to 3 first

pick the opposite and that in the winner

somehow make the enter key do nothing or make it trigger the add button
